A sample repository containing intentionally insecure code and infrastructure-as-code (IaC) configurations for testing **SAST**, **SCA**, and **IaC** scanning tools

---

## Overview

This repository is designed for security testing, scanning, and training purposes. It includes:

- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing) targets:** `main.py` with hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, command injection, and insecure deserialization patterns.
- **SCA (Software Composition Analysis) targets:** `requirements.txt` with outdated and vulnerable Python dependencies.
- **IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code) targets:** `cloudformation/template.yaml` and `terraform/main.tf` containing overly permissive IAM policies, public S3 buckets, and open security groups.
- **Dockerfile:** with environment secrets, running as root, and unpinned dependencies.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Do **not** deploy these resources to production or public cloud accounts. Use in isolated test environments only.

## Usage

1. **SAST Testing**  
   Run your static analysis tools on `main.py` to detect code issues such as hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, command injection, and insecure deserialization.

2. **SCA Testing**  
   Use dependency scanning tools against `requirements.txt` to detect outdated and vulnerable packages.

3. **IaC Testing**  
   Use IaC scanning tools on `cloudformation/template.yaml` and `terraform/main.tf` to detect misconfigurations like public S3 buckets and overly permissive IAM policies.

4. **Dockerfile Analysis**  
   Scan the Dockerfile to detect secrets in environment variables, root execution, and unpinned base images.

## Notes

- All code, configurations, and Docker images are intentionally insecure for testing purposes.
- Always run in isolated or ephemeral environments.
- This repository can serve as a lab for security teams, developers learning secure coding practices, or CI/CD pipeline testing.
